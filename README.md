Bookshop

This project imitates an online book webshop where the costumer can order books. Users can filter the books by age category and search for titles and authors. Selected books can be added to the cart, and after filling in the postal and payment information, the order can be submitted. The total price is calculated with every added book and the shipping fee is 0 after 15.000 Ft.

After registration and logging in (which is available through the 'Admin' page), books can be added to the database, deleted (on their book detail pages) and edited (also on their book detail pages).

Cookie consent needs to be OK-d every session.

The project uses mock backend.

Technologies and packages:
- Angular
- Bootstrap
- JSON Server
- NGX Cookie Service
- ngx-pagination

After installing all packages, the project can be started with 'ng serve', and the backend with 'npx nodemon mock-server.js'.
