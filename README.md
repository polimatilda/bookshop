Bookshop

This project imitates an online book webshop where the costumer can order books. Users can filter the books by age category and search for titles and authors. Selected books can be added to the cart, and after filling in the postal and payment information, the order can be submitted.

After registration and logging in (which is available through the 'Admin' page), books can be added to the database, deleted (on their book detail pages) and edited (also on their book detail pages).

Cookie consent needs to be OK-d every session.
